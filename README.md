# ADAS-simulation
Welcome to this repository!

I'm currently a third year student of a 3 year Master's degree in electrical and computer engineering called ENSEA, in France.

This is a repository I made for my 2nd year internship in image processing.
I worked on a vehicle simulator from a french company called 4D Virtualiz. 
The goal was to implement ADAS features like lane centering, pedestrian and zebra detection. Then I had to make a car autonomous which does a small circuit
